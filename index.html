        <h2 class="grenze">Grenze Gotisch</h2>
        <p>designed by Omnibus-Type, is a striking display typeface that draws inspiration from traditional Gothic
            lettering, blending historic elements with modern aesthetics. Its sharp angles and prominent points evoke a
            sense of strength and drama, while the high contrast between thick and thin strokes enhances its visual
            impact, making it particularly effective for headlines and decorative uses. The distinctive letterforms
            feature elaborate serifs and ornate details, contributing to a bold personality, and the overall design
            emphasizes verticality, giving the typeface a tall, commanding presence. Despite its decorative nature,
            Grenze Gotisch maintains legibility, especially in larger sizes, making it suitable for posters, book
            covers, and other applications where a dramatic impact is desired. This typeface conveys tradition and
            personality, making it ideal for projects aiming to evoke a historic or cultural theme, ensuring that any
            design stands out with its memorable and captivating style.</p>
